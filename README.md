# .NETII-FinalProject
A Magic the Gathering project using a MSSQL database and .NET framework

**11/8/21**
Finished the user login and signup. On login, the user's email is passed through checking for their roles and updating the Mainwindow accordingly. On signup, a new user
is placed in the DB and then logged in using those credentials. 

**11/14/21**
Finished the fake card accessor and manager along with the tests associated with them. Currently, the user does not have a way to view the cards 
on separate "pages" unless they change the code in the MainWindow. Will be the next update along with the actual CardAccessor being finished.
